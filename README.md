# team-slack-bot
A slack bot for engineering teams (to get various stats and perform team related actions).
 
 Things it does:
 * TBD


## Installation
* Create a Slack app 
* TBD


## Commands
* TBD


## Ideas:

* A command to return all open threads in #asks-unicorn (everything that doesn't have a V emoji)
* A command to return all open Tier 4 Zendesk ticket (a paratemer to include the last comment for each / another command to get the detais for a tier 4 ticket)
* A 'compliment' / 'tease' mechanism
* An 'Assemble' function (that posts a DM message to the team)
* Before responding, verify that the requestor is a unicorn member?
* Make it configurable as possible (so that can later be used by others as well)
* Add the app permission to custom the sending user details and support providing the bot name / icon via config
* Comment on a thread when someone tags @unicorn! (except for specific channels)
* Post a funny quote when someone uses a predefined keyword (SSO/team member)
